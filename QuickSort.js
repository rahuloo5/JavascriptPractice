// Best-case time complexity of Quick Sort
// The best-case time complexity of Quick Sort is of O(nlog(n)).

// The log(n) comes from the number of decompositions (divisions into subarrays) that have to be done. Then we have O(n) comparisons per decomposition.
// Worst-case time complexity of Quick Sort
// The worst-case time complexity of Quick Sort is of O(n^2).

// The worst case is when we have a sorted array and we start from the smallest or largest value; this requires n decompositions, and with n comparisons per decomposition, this results in O(n^2). So, the Big O of Quick Sort is n^2 â€“ quadratic time complexity.

// To prevent this worst case, it is best to pick a middle or random value when selecting the pivot. The first (as in this example) or last element of the array are often chosen for simplicity.
